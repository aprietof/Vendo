# VendOmatic, project, and goals here
VendOmatic is created by 3 people: Adrian Prieto, John Verdone and Karuna Sehgal.

Our app uses Angular, Materialize and Firebase. The app is a restaurant management app for restaurant owners and vendors. Restaurant owners can keep their vendors organized, find new vendors to improve quality. Vendors can keep their restaurants organized, keep track of products offered, cultivate new business. Each user can place and track outstanding orders and keep track of invoicing.
